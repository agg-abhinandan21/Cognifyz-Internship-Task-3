🔍 Dashboard Highlights:

Avenue-wise Analysis: Covers Equity, Fixed Deposits, Mutual Funds, and Public Provident Fund.

Objective Insights: Majority of investors aim for Capital Appreciation, followed by Growth and Income.

Saving Motives for Equity: Retirement Planning (60%+), Health Care, and Education emerge as primary goals.

Gender Distribution: Balanced representation between male and female investors.

Dynamic Filtering: All visuals update instantly based on selected investment avenue or gender.

🛠 Tools & Skills Used:

DAX Functions for Calculations

Power Query for Data Cleaning & Transformation

Interactive Charts (Donut, Bar, KPI Cards, Slicers)

📈 Learning Takeaway: Strengthened my expertise in data storytelling, business insights, and interactive dashboard design to transform raw data into actionable decisions.
